      // age = 200;
      // console.log(age, age2);
      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // const team = players;
      // console.log(players, team);
      // // karena kita updated team tapi team bukan array, team adalah referensi original array yang mana adalah players.
      // // jadi players ikut berubah
      // team[3] = "lex";

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      const team2 = players.slice(2, 3);

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "Budi";
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      team5[3] = "Yanto";
      console.log(team5);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:

      // const captain = person;
      // captain.age = 99;
      // console.log(captain.age);

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 32 });

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const cap3 = [...person]

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
